# Hallucination Detection Tool Failure Analysis Report

**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Issue:** Critical failure in `check_ai_script_hallucinations` tool  
**Severity:** HIGH - Tool provides false confidence while missing obvious hallucinations  

## Executive Summary

The `check_ai_script_hallucinations` tool is currently **non-functional** and providing dangerously misleading results. It reports 90% confidence and 0% hallucination rate while failing to detect obvious API misuse and non-existent functions. This investigation reveals a likely root cause related to recent refactoring.

## Issue Description

### Observed Behavior
- **False Negatives**: Tool fails to detect obvious hallucinations
- **Empty Analysis**: All usage tracking lists are empty (`classes_used: []`, `methods_called: []`, etc.)
- **False Confidence**: Reports 90% confidence despite broken analysis
- **Missing Validations**: Should validate ~10+ API calls but only reports 1-2 validations

### Test Results

#### Test 1: voltage_divider.py Analysis
```json
{
  "hallucinations_detected": [],
  "validation_summary": {
    "total_validations": 2,
    "hallucination_rate": 0.0
  },
  "libraries_analyzed": [{
    "classes_used": [],
    "methods_called": [],
    "functions_called": []
  }]
}
```

#### Test 2: Obvious Hallucination Test
Script containing `fake_method_that_does_not_exist()` and `fake_function_call()`:
```json
{
  "hallucinations_detected": [],
  "validation_summary": {
    "total_validations": 1,
    "hallucination_rate": 0.0
  }
}
```

## Root Cause Hypothesis

### Recent Refactoring Impact
The tool was recently refactored to accept **script content as string** instead of **file paths**:

**Before (File-based):**
```python
async def check_ai_script_hallucinations(script_path: str) -> str:
    # Tool would read file from disk and parse it
```

**After (Content-based):**
```python
async def check_ai_script_hallucinations(script_content: str, filename: str = "script.py") -> str:
    # Tool receives content directly
```

### Potential Issues

1. **AST Parser Context Loss**
   - File-based parsers may rely on filesystem context
   - Temporary file creation may have different behavior
   - Module resolution might work differently

2. **Import Resolution Problems**
   - `from skidl import *` analysis may require file context
   - Dynamic imports might not resolve in string-only context
   - Module path detection could be broken

3. **Temporary File Handling**
   - Tool creates temporary files but may not preserve structure
   - File extensions or paths might affect parsing
   - Working directory context could be lost

## Evidence Supporting Hypothesis

### 1. Knowledge Graph Data is Correct
Manual exploration confirms:
- ✅ SKiDL repository properly indexed (272 files, 62 classes, 383 functions)
- ✅ `generate_bom()` correctly identified as non-existent
- ✅ `generate_netlist()` correctly identified as Circuit method
- ✅ Part and Net classes properly indexed

### 2. API Endpoint Works
- ✅ HTTP requests successful (200 status)
- ✅ JSON responses well-formed
- ✅ No network or server errors

### 3. Analysis Pipeline Broken
- ❌ AST extraction returns empty lists
- ❌ No function calls detected in any script
- ❌ No class usage detected despite obvious usage
- ❌ Validation counts extremely low

## Known Hallucinations Missed

### voltage_divider.py
1. **`generate_bom()`** - Function doesn't exist (confirmed via knowledge graph)
2. **Incorrect Usage Patterns:**
   - `generate_netlist()` called as function (should be Circuit method)
   - `generate_schematic()` called as function (should be Circuit method)
   - `ERC()` called as function (should be Circuit method)
   - `vin.drive = POWER` used as attribute (should be method call)

### test_hallucinations.py
1. **`fake_method_that_does_not_exist()`** - Obviously fake method
2. **`fake_function_call()`** - Obviously fake function

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Risks
- **False Security**: Agents believe their code is validated when it's not
- **Production Issues**: Hallucinated APIs will cause runtime failures
- **Development Inefficiency**: Bad code passes validation, causing downstream problems

### Pipeline Impact
- Code Correction Agent relies on this tool for validation loops
- Validation Agent provides meaningless confidence scores
- Overall quality assurance is compromised

## Recommended Investigation Steps

### 1. Compare File vs Content Analysis
```python
# Test both approaches with same script
result_file = check_ai_script_hallucinations(script_path="/path/to/test.py")
result_content = check_ai_script_hallucinations(script_content=content, filename="test.py")
# Compare results
```

### 2. Debug AST Parsing Pipeline
- Add logging to AST extraction code
- Verify if function calls, class instantiations are detected
- Check if import analysis works with string content

### 3. Validate Temporary File Creation
- Verify temporary files are created correctly
- Check if file extensions are preserved
- Ensure working directory context

### 4. Test Import Resolution
- Test with various import patterns (`from skidl import *`, `import skidl`)
- Verify module resolution works in string context
- Check if relative imports cause issues

## Alternative Solution: Knowledge Graph-Based Validation

If the refactoring issue cannot be resolved quickly, we recommend implementing validation using direct `query_knowledge_graph` calls:

### Proposed Architecture
```python
def validate_script_with_knowledge_graph(script_content: str) -> ValidationResult:
    # 1. Parse AST manually to extract calls
    ast_tree = ast.parse(script_content)
    
    # 2. Extract function calls, method calls, class usage
    calls = extract_api_calls(ast_tree)
    
    # 3. Validate each call against knowledge graph
    for call in calls:
        result = query_knowledge_graph(f"method {call.name}")
        if not result.success:
            # Mark as hallucination
            
    # 4. Return comprehensive validation results
```

### Benefits
- **Direct Control**: No dependency on broken AST pipeline
- **Accurate Results**: Use proven knowledge graph data
- **Flexible**: Can implement custom validation logic
- **Reliable**: Based on working query_knowledge_graph tool

## Priority Assessment

**CRITICAL PRIORITY** - This issue affects core validation functionality and could lead to production failures. Recommend:

1. **Immediate**: Investigate file vs content parsing difference
2. **Short-term**: Implement knowledge graph-based validation as backup
3. **Long-term**: Fix root cause or redesign validation architecture

## Conclusion

The hallucination detection tool failure is likely caused by the recent refactoring from file-based to content-based analysis. The AST parsing pipeline appears to be broken in the string context, while the knowledge graph data and query functionality work correctly.

**Recommendation**: Investigate the parsing difference immediately, and prepare knowledge graph-based validation as a fallback solution to maintain system reliability.
