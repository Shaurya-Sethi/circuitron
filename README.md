# Circuitron

Circuitron is an agentic PCB design accelerator that transforms natural language prompts into SKiDL code, KiCad schematics, and routed PCB layouts. It assists professional power-electronics engineers by automating routine steps while keeping humans in the loop for review and approval.

Part selection now leverages SKiDL's full search syntax: queries may contain multiple terms, quoted phrases, regular expressions, and OR pipes for precise component lookup.
