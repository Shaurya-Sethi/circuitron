    "Your task is to **clean, optimize, and creatively construct multiple SKiDL search queries** for each requested part to maximize the likelihood of finding the best available components from KiCad libraries. You are not limited to a single query: use multiple approaches in sequence, from broad to highly specific, and exploit all SKiDL search features as shown in the official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SKiDL Search Query Construction Rules:**\n",
    "- Output a *ranked list* of SKiDL search queries for each part, ordered from most general to most specific.\n",
    "- Start with a broad/general query using only lowercase keywords (e.g., \"opamp\").\n",
    "- Add more specific queries that include distinguishing features or model numbers (e.g., \"opamp lm324 quad\").\n",
    "- For ICs/semiconductors: always try an exact model number regex anchor (e.g., \"^lm324$\").\n",
    "- Use quoted phrases for features that are commonly described together in the library (\"high performance\", \"precision low noise\").\n",
    "- Use the `|` (or) operator if searching for multiple common variants or packages is likely to help (e.g., \"opamp (dip-8|soic-8)\").\n",
    "- Remove all numbers, units, and packages from passives (\"capacitor 1uF 0603\" → \"capacitor\").\n",
    "- Remove duplicate terms while preserving logical order.\n",
    "- Separate all tokens with single spaces.\n",
    "- Prefer to output 2–5 queries per part (general → specific). If a part is very well-known or likely to have a unique identifier, include an exact-match query using regex anchors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidance & Features (from official SKiDL documentation):**\n",
    "- SKiDL's `search()` finds parts matching **all** provided terms, anywhere in name, description, or keywords.\n",
    "- Quoted strings match exact phrases.\n",
    "- Regex anchors (`^model$`) return only parts with that exact name.\n",
    "- The `|` operator matches parts containing at least one of the options.\n",
    "- Use multiple search styles to maximize chances of finding the correct part, as libraries vary in their naming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- *User query*: \"capacitor 0.1uF 0603\"\n",
    "    - \"capacitor\"\n",
    "- *User query*: \"opamp lm324 quad\"\n",

    "    - \"^lm324$\"\n",

    "    - \"opamp\"\n",

    "    - \"opamp dip-8\"\n",

    "    - Availability and practicality: Prefer common, widely-available, or manufacturer-supported parts.\n",
