# UI/UX Improvement: Generated Files Panel (Issue 6)

Date: 2025-08-10

Summary
- Replaced raw file links output with a concise summary and a Rich table for generated files.
- The panel now shows execution status (success or completed with issues), brief notes from stdout/stderr, and a table listing each file with name, type, size, and an Open link.

Changes
- Updated `circuitron/ui/app.py`:
  - `display_files` now accepts either the full result dict from `execute_final_script` or a list of paths.
  - Shows an "Output Summary" panel (status + notes) and renders the files via a table.
  - Tweaked `display_generated_files_summary` to present a compact, link-rich preview.
- Added to `circuitron/ui/components/tables.py`:
  - `show_generated_files(console, file_paths)` to render a Rich table with columns: #, Name, Type, Size, Open.
  - Helpers `_human_size` and `_file_type_label` for improved readability.

Verification
- Activated the project venv and ran test suite: all tests pass.

Notes
- Pipeline remains unchanged; it already passes the execute result dict to `ui.display_files`.
- If needed, we can further add a derived "Saved to <folder>" header using the common parent of returned paths.
