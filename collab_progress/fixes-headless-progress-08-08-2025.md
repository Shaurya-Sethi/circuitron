# Headless Mode & Progress Interface fixes â€” 08-08-2025

## Summary
- Acted on task.md items: ensured basic code validation feedback during generation and corrected pipeline docstring. Verified that UI wiring, stage finalization, and sink usage are correctly implemented across app/cli/pipeline.

## Files Changed
- circuitron/pipeline.py
  - Use validate_code_generation_results return to surface an explicit warning during code generation.
  - Docstring of pipeline() updated to include sink and feedback_provider and fixed indentation.

## Rationale
- Prevents silent failures when the generator omits critical imports.
- Keeps docs accurate for headless progress reporting and feedback callbacks.

## Verification
- Ran pytest: all tests passed (132 total).
- Manual scan confirms try/finally around finish_stage in all helpers, UI forwards collect_feedback, and CLI passes sink & feedback_provider.

## Issues
- Linting tools (ruff) not installed in the provided venv; skipped. No functional issues detected.

## Next Steps
- Optionally install and run ruff/mypy to enforce style and types in CI.
- Consider adding tests around the new basic validation warning path.
