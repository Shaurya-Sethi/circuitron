# Collaboration & Progress Tracker

This folder tracks implementation progress and provides a shared space for AI agents and humans to review changes.

Conventions:
- Add progress notes as Markdown files named with a descriptive title and the date in dd-mm-yyyy format, e.g., `phase-1-headless-mode-08-08-2025.md`.
- Keep entries concise: summary, files changed, rationale, verification status, and next steps.
- Prefer deltas over restating prior context.
