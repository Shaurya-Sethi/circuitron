# Container Cleanup for Tests (10-08-2025)

## Summary
Some pytest runs left `circuitron-kicad-*` containers running. Implemented robust pre/post test cleanup and hardened the low-level cleanup helper to avoid leaks and be safe when Docker isn't available.

## Files Changed
- `circuitron/docker_session.py`
  - `cleanup_stale_containers` now safely handles `FileNotFoundError` when Docker isn't present; removal wrapped in try/except.
- `tests/conftest.py`
  - Added session-scoped, autouse fixture `_clean_circuitron_containers_session` to remove `circuitron-kicad-*` and `circuitron-final-*` containers before and after the test session.

## Rationale
- Tests—and occasionally failures/interruptions—could leave containers behind. Cleaning at session boundaries ensures a tidy environment. Handling `FileNotFoundError` makes tests resilient in CI or local envs without Docker.

## Verification
- Activated venv and ran full test suite: `pytest -q` -> all tests passed.
- Manual spot-check: fixture runs automatically at session start/end.

## Issues
- None observed. Cleanup is best-effort; if Docker is not running, we skip silently.

## Next Steps
- Consider trapping OS signals in CLI to call `kicad_session.stop()` more broadly (already partially covered).
